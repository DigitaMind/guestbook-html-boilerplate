# Guestbook Html Boilerplate

This boilerplate helps you focus on the backend tool or web project you are trying to build instead of getting hung up on the details. Forget worries about how it looks or same old HTML that you already know and focus on what you are trying to learn.

Why Guestbook Html Boilerplate? Aren't you tired of building Todo apps already?? LOL

Built with Semantic UI - http://www.semantic-ui.com for frontend.

# Coding Challenge

## Business Problem:
A guestbook app basically allows you store records of people that visit your site by collecting personal information such as Name, Email, and Comment.
### Challenge:
Develop a landing page that displays the records in your database, a form to create new records, and pages to edit and delete existing records (CRUD).

### Assumptions:
- Create a client application leveraging on the provided HTML template, using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Angular)
- Persist data to a MySQL database
- Build a RESTful API with PHP Slim Framework to serve the CRUD http requests from the React or Angular client.

### Instructions:
- Clone this repository
- Create a new private repository on Github.
- Leverage on the HTML templates provided to build the UI components.
- Save the client (Angular or React) in a client folder and save the PHP Slim backend service in the Server folder of the root directory of your repository.
- Save the database script (sql) in the SQL folder of the root directory as with the Client and Server folders mentioned above.
- Add this username as a contributor to your private repository upon completion.
- Send a mail to the HR to officially communicate your submission.
- Cheers!
