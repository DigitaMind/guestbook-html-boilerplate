# Guestbook Html Boilerplate

This boilerplate helps you focus on the backend tool or web project you are trying to build instead of getting hung up on the details. Forget worries about how it looks or same old HTML that you already know and focus on what you are trying to learn.

Why Guestbook Html Boilerplate? Aren't you tired of building Todo apps already?? LOL

# Coding Challenge

## Business Problem:
A guestbook app basically allows you store records of people that visit your site by collecting personal information such as Name, Email, and Comment.
### Challenge:
Develop a landing page that displays the records in your database, a form to create new records, and pages to edit and delete existing records (CRUD).

### Assumptions:
- Create a client application leveraging on the provided HTML template, using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Angular)
- Persist data to a MySQL database
- Build a RESTful API with PHP Slim Framework to serve the CRUD http requests from the React or Angular client.
